My name is Justinas and I am a data scientist. I have a variety of experience across the data ecosystem including one-off analysis projects, building Machine Learning models and leading the development of data powered software. The main languages I use are Python and SQL. Currently, I am focusing on increasing my knowledge in ML model deployment in Production and statistical testing.

Outside of work I have been a life-long fan of basketball üèÄ (I support my hometown ≈Ωalgiris and Boston Celtics). I am keen adventure sailor with multiple trips across the Baltic Sea under my belt. Recently, I have gotten into photography üì∏ and mixed martial arts ü•ã.

Want to discuss anything from the above or something else? Do not hesitate to get in touch!
